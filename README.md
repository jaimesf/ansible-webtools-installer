# Ansible Web Tools Installer

You can install easily the basic service for a little startup, that doesn't need a big infrastructure to work. 
Change vars to your needs, the target host, and just execute 
```
./install_cloud.sh
```
You will have a private cloud, instant messaging, online document editor and an e-mail server.

Additionaly, if you need an CI/CD environment for software development startup, your command is
```
./install_devtools.sh
```
This give you Gitlab, Jenkins, Nexus installations automatically.

Or if you need all of them, the magic words are:
```
./install_all.sh
```

# HTTPS certificates

All services will be deployed over HTTPS, and certificates are needed.

### Auto generated
If your server will have access from Internet, you can use the free https certs generator [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), setting up **public_server** var to **True**. This option generate https certs for all services subdomains to install, and you don't pay attention to renovate it.

### Manual certificates
If your server won't be accessed from Internet, or if it's public and you have certs for all subdomains, you can put your certs on their directories, and these will be installed.

Your certs have to be named as:
* Certificate: **cert.pem**
* Private key: **privkey.pem**
* CA cert: **chain.pem**
 
Directories to save your certs:
* **roles/proxy/files/root_certs** for root certs, to you main domain {{root_domain}} (Only if you set up **install_root** var to _True_)
* **roles/proxycloud/files/cloud_certs** for Nextcloud certs, to default subdomain cloud.{{root_domain}}
* **roles/proxycloud/files/collabora_certs** for Collabora certs, to default subdomain collabora.{{root_domain}}
* **roles/proxycloud/files/onlyoffice_certs** for Onlyoffice certs, to default subdomain onlyoffice.{{root_domain}}
* **roles/proxycloud/files/mail_certs** for e-mail certs, to default subdomain mail.{{root_domain}}
* **roles/proxycloud/files/ldap_certs** for LDAP certs, to default subdomain ldap.{{root_domain}}
* **roles/proxydevtools/files/gitlab_certs** for Gitlab certs, to default subdomain gitlab.{{root_domain}}
* **roles/proxydevtools/files/jenkins_certs** for Jenkins certs, to default subdomain jenkins.{{root_domain}}
* **roles/proxydevtools/files/nexus_certs** for Nexus certs, to default subdomain nexus.{{root_domain}}

# Playbooks and installers

[Ansible playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html) is a list of independent complex tasks (Named as [roles](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)), to execute consecutively to reach you target.

Three playbooks exist:
* **install_cloud.yml**: Define list of roles to install all cloud services (E-mail, OpenLDAP, Nextcloud, Collabora, Onlyoffice).
* **install_devtools.yml**: Define list of roles to install all development services (Gitlab, Jenkins, Nexus).
* **install_all.yml**: Define list of roles to install all cloud and development services.

Related to these playbook, exists three script to launch easily the playbooks:
* **install_cloud.sh**: Install cloud services via **install_cloud.yml** playbook.
* **install_devtools.sh**: Install devtools services via **install_cloud.yml** playbook.
* **install_all.sh**: Install all services via **install_all.yml** playbook.

# Hosts

To execute installer, you will need modify hosts.cfg to enter your access data.

Example: 
```
10.0.0.12      ansible_ssh_user=myuser  ansible_ssh_pass=mypassword ansible_become_pass=mypassword
```

If your user, it's not the _root_ user, you need sudo permissions to execute this installer and ansible_become_pass is required.


# Installation

First of all, _you need to install Ansible on your machine (Not the server, you own computer)_ to execute installer. Ansible can be installed on many ways, described on it's [website](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).

Steps to install:

1. Set up [DNS config](#dns)
2. [Forward ports](#network) to your server if needed.
3. Set up you target host on [hosts.cfg](#hosts).
4. Set up **root_domain** var on [global-vars.yml](#global_varsyml)
5. Setup for https certs
    1. Auto generated certs: Set up **email_certbot** var on [global-vars.yml](#global_varsyml) and **public_server** to True
    2. Own certs: Copy all [your certs properly named to their directories](#manual-certificates)
6. Set up other vars, as _admin passwords_.
7. Execute the installer you need:
    1. **./install_cloud.sh** to install all cloud services.
    2. **./install_devtools.sh** to install all dev tools services.
    3. **./install_all.sh** to install all services
8. If you installed Jenkins and Nexus, last role, show you admin passwords.

After the installation process you can access services on this URIs if you didn't change subdomains
* **Nextloud**: https://cloud.yourdomain.com
* **E-mail**: https://mail.yourdomain.com
* **LDAP**: ldaps://ldap.yourdomain.com:636
* **LDAP admin**: https://ldap.yourdomain.com. To log in the interface, the default user is "**cn=admin,dc=mydomain,dc=com**" and the password on var _**initial_openldap_admin_password**_
* **Collabora**: https://collabora.yourdomain.com doesn't show you nothing. This URI is for configure collabora on Nextcloud.
* **Onlyoffice**: https://onlyoffice.yourdomain.com doesn't show you nothing relevant. This URI is for configure Onlyoffice on Nextcloud.
* **Gitlab**: https://gitlab.yourdomain.com
* **Jenkins**: https://jenkins.yourdomain.com
* **Nexus**: https://nexus.yourdomain.com

### Problems on installation

* If you can't connect to your server at execute playbooks, first log in to your server manually and accept ssh cert. Ex:`ssh root@10.0.0.15`
